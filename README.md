# OpenCV pre-processing
OpenCV/Python3 toy examples with various pre-processing (mainly for edge/shape extraction) :
- ZCA : Zero Phase Whitening
- Gabor Filters bank : edge extraction 
- LCN : Local Contrast Normalization
- Laplacian : edge detection
- DoG : Difference of Gaussian for edge detection
- Sobel derivative : edge detection
- DoG_Pyramid : difference of gaussian pyramid for keypoint extraction
